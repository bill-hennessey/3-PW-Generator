# 3-PW-Generator

## Description

My task was to take a bit of Javascript starter code and turn it into a functioning password generator. The acceptance criteria stated that it must take in user input (e.g. character count, use lower/uppercase, numbers and special characters) and make the generator functional with JS.

I took quite a bit of time to build all the required logic: compiling arrays with the user input, using that to build arrays of characters (pools) and ivoking methods to pull random characters from available options and display them in the html.

I learned quite a bit about Javascript generally. I think the biggest takeaway was the importance of pseudocode. Taking all the things from these other things and moving them here and doing this method with the data, etc. As stated in class, it really is just finding ways to gather and contain data and doing things with the data.

## Installation

nothing to install. Simply access my github page found here:

https://bill-hennessey.github.io/3-PW-Generator/

## Usage

Click the "Generate Password" button. You will begin to see prompts at the top asking about how many and what types of characters the app will use when compiling the password. You must choose at least 1 or the questions will begin again. After you answer all the questions your new password will display in the text area.
